# Project_Microbiome
Project repository rs-fMRI of germfree and na√Øve mice with/without cortical stroke. 
The aim of this study was to characterize the effect of the gut microbiota in mice with experimental stroke using functional connectivity analysis. 

## Step-by-Step guide to replicate the analysis

1. Download MRI raw and processed data (raw_data/proc_data) from [G-Node](https://doi.org/10.12751/g-node.699mgv). The proc_data is grouped, thus GF/SPF, naive/stroke mice are grouped in the correct subfolder already. Further, we provide the AIDAmri and AIDAconnect versions used for analysis - this way you save time with pre-set input parameters to reproduce all steps!

2. Install [AIDAmri](https://github.com/aswendtlab/AIDAmri) and [AIDAconnect](https://github.com/aswendtlab/AIDAconnect). Note! Anaconda Python 3 installation and Matlab_R2018/2019 are required, see the manuals for install instructions. 

3. Run AIDAmri pre- and postprocessing steps for T2 and rs-fMRI data, see [manual](https://github.com/aswendtlab/AIDAmri/blob/master/manual.pdf). Note! To save time, you can use ```batchProc.py```. If you do not use the AIDAmri version provided together with the data set, make sure to adjust ```process_fMRI.py``` (or your tool to extract the rs-fMRI time series) with the correct repetition time ```-t 1.42``` and the frequency range ```cutOff_high_sec = 100.0 cutOff_low_sec = 12.5```.

4. Extract the graph theoretical measures using AIDAconnect and Matlab
   1. Load the data and generate the graphs``` mergeDTIdata_input.m```
   2. To generate matrices use ```plotCorrelationMatrices.m``` (a full list of the atlas labels can be found [here](https://github.com/aswendtlab/AIDAconnect/blob/master/Tools/infoData/acronyms_splitted.mat))

   3. To generate the histogram plots (frequency of degree/node strength) use ```plotDistribution.m``` range 1-50 (strength), 1-100 (degree).\

   6. To generate the total degree/node strength plots (group difference needs to be calculated separately) use ```compareTotalStrength.m```, ```compareTotalDegree.m``` The function was written for multiple time points - you can ignore this as there is only one time point (P0) in this study.\

   7. To generate the graphs with 20 top connections (ranked according to the Pearson correlation) use ```analyzeMostConnected.m```.\

   8. To visualize a subnetwork of the whole brain graph use ```plotSelectedregions.m```.\

   9. To calculate global measures (e.g. density, modularity, etc.) use ```plotGlobalParameter.m```.\

   11. To calculate the correlation/edge weight between two regions use ```plotConnectionWeight.m``` and for all other local measures use ```plotLocalParameter.m```.\
